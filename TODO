Small todo list of what needs to be done still here:

* Use hash of the first post as ThreadID so that the IDs are consistent even when you load only a sub-part of the data.
* Check encoding of content/title/authors...
* Adjust the 'legacy_id' field to contain the correct information (see this with the pipermail guys)
