Small todo list of what needs to be done still here:

* Use hash of the first post as ThreadID so that the IDs are consistent even when you load only a sub-part of the data.
* Check encoding of content/title/authors...
* Split the From field into two fields:
  - From the name of the author
  - Email the email of the author (that can be used for the captcha)
* Add a 'Full' field or something to keep the complete email (including gpg key &co)
* Add a 'legacy_id' field containing the identifier used by pipermail (useful for forwarding)
